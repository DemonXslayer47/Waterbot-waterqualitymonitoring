Abstract
Monitoring the quality of the water is necessary to safeguard both the environment and human health. We
propose the creation of the Waterbot Smart water monitoring system in this project, which makes use of
IoT technology to continuously check water quality. Data on many aspects of water quality, including CL,
NH4, NO2, SO4, dissolved oxygen, will be gathered by the system using sensors. To anticipate water
quality parameters and identify abnormalities in the data, preprocessed data will be used with machine
learning algorithms. The suggested system will contain edge devices to process and analyze data in realtime right at the source, minimizing the need for centralized processing and enabling quick reactions to
any irregularities. The system will transport data to the cloud for archival and subsequent processing
using Wi-Fi and cellular networks. The proposed technology will be useful in several sectors, including
aquaculture, agriculture, and water treatment facilities. The Waterbot Smart water monitoring system will
continuously monitor the quality of the water and enable early identification of any anomalies, allowing
for improved water management decisions and environmental and human health protection.
